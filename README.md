Made this little project with a lot of ðŸ’—.

I tried to use all the tools available in Vue, Nuxt and JS.
I have done similar things in different ways to show different approaches to the same task.

I hope you like it as much as I loved creating it.

## Build Setup
```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate

```
